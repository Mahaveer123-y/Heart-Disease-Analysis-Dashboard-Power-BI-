# Heart-Disease-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-
📘 Project Overview This project visualizes heart disease data using Power BI, providing insights into patient survival rates, age distribution, and the effects of various health factors like smoking, anaemia, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

📊 Dashboard Highlights

Overall Survival Rate: 67.89%
Average Age of Survival: 58.76 years
Total Survivors: 203 | Total Deaths: 96
Key Visuals:
Survival by Age Group
Serum Creatinine vs Survival Count
Ejection Fraction Trends
Impact of Smoking & Other Conditions

🧠 Tools & Skills Used
Power BI
DAX Functions
Data Cleaning & Transformation
Data Visualization & Dashboard Design
Statistical Analysis

⚙️ Project Workflow
Loaded and cleaned the dataset in Power Query
Created calculated measures for survival analysis
Designed visuals for different patient groups
Added interactivity and navigation menus
Built the final dashboard view


🩺 Key Insights
Survival rate decreases significantly after age 60
High serum creatinine and low ejection fraction link with lower survival
Lifestyle factors (smoking, diabetes, anaemia) impact patient outcomes
